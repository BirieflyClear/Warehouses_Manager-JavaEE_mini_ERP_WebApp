# WarehouseWebApp
Java web app for managing a database 

Written using Java (JavaEE) Servlets, JSP and local MySQL database.
<TODO: deploy the app>

### NOTE: This is my first (old) project with JavaEE Servlets and JSP and my first web application at all, so the code could be better and needs to be refactored (in some free time).
